# ASSESSMENT 5: Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is a hash in Ruby?

  Your answer: A hash in Ruby is like an array containing a set of key/value pairs. 

  Researched answer: A hash in Ruby holds data in key/value pairs and is similar to arrays. 

2. What is a gem?

  Your answer: I recall that a gem is associated with testing in Ruby, but I unfortunately cannot recall the exact definition. I'd be happy to research the subject further and reach out with my findings. 

  Researched answer: Gems are open source libraries that package data and contain Ruby code. An example of a gem would be Rails. 


3. What is Ruby on Rails?

  Your answer: Ruby on Rails is a web development framework that is similiar to React, using the Ruby language as opposed to JavaScript. Ruby on Rails is also used for database management. 

  Researched answer: Ruby on Rails is a web application framework written in the Ruby language. It was released as open source code and uses an (MVC) framework.


4. What is a relational database? Are there other kinds of databases?

  Your answer: A relational database is like an excel spreadsheet, with columns and rows. There are other kinds of databases that I cannot remember at this time. 


  Researched answer: A relational database is like Google Sheets or an Excel spreadsheet in that information is displayed in a table format with rows and columns. Some other kinds of databases include NoSQL databases, or those that don't use SQL as their primary data access language, and cloud databases. 
  

5. What are primary keys? Why are they important?

  Your answer: Primary keys are unique identifiers that are automatically assigned to instances in a database. They are important because they prevent accidental modification of instances that may have duplicate attributes. 

  Researched answer: Primary keys are used in Rails, and are identified by an "id", which is always unique to an instance. They are important because they prevent issues from arising when working with instances that have the same name.  


## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week
Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. RESTful routes: Rest stands for Representational State Transfer. A RESTful route brings operations that can be applied to an object into HTTP requests. Routes have structures with and without parameters. 


2. JSON: JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation that follows JavaScript object syntax. It is used to hold collections of data and transmit data across a network. JSON is text only, allowing it to be sent between computers. 

3. ERB: ERB is an extension, standing for Embedded Ruby, also known as Templated Ruby. ERB allows coding in HTML, with Ruby inserted into the view file. 

4. Params: Params, or parameters, allow us to pass a value into the controller. They are used in routes, making the page more dynamic. 

5. API: API stands for Application Programming Interface. Some types of APIS include Web APIs, Server APIs, and Browser APIs. An example of an API would be the retrieval of data by a server from a mobile app, the interpretation of the data, and the behind-the-scenes actions that allow for the data to be sent back to a user's phone. The final process would be the interpetation of data into a readable format.
